* Dockerfiles

Similar to a dotfiles repo, this is for various Docker setups. There
is one standalone tool, flastaff, while the others are templates for
inclusion (FROM foo) in other projects.

There are two Docker images here, [[puck/Readme.org][puck]] and [[falstaff/Readme.org][falstaff]]:
- puck is small and quick
- falstaff is a more interesting big fatty (and proud of it, thank you very much)
